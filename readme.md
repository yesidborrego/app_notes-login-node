# Notes App CRUD with login.

This's a project created to practice using NodeJS with the framework Express, database MongoDB, control of session with express-session, authentication with Passport and view engine EJS.

This App allows you to create "Notes" according to the registered user.

This exercise was taken from [Fazt's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMn28O1sQGochG94HdlthbA), which I recommend.
